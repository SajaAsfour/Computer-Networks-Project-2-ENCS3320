# 🌐 Computer Networks Project - ENCS3320

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my implementation of **Project #2 for the Computer Networks (ENCS3320) course at Birzeit University**. The project involves designing and configuring a network using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and implementing essential network protocols and services.

## 🛠 Features

### ✅ **Part 0: IP Subnetting & Assignment**
- Assigned IP addresses based on **student ID 1210737**.
- Created subnet masks and address ranges for all subnets.

### ✅ **Part 1: Network Topology Design**
- Built the network topology in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
- Configured routers, switches, servers, and PCs with appropriate IP addresses.

### ✅ **Part 2: Server Configuration**
- Configured a **DNS & Web Server** with the domain `www.FirstSem2024.com`.
- Designed a **custom website** with HTML & CSS.
- Configured a **Mail Server** with user authentication.

### ✅ **Part 3: Routing Protocol Configuration**
- Implemented **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** with:
  - Process ID: **10**
  - Multiple OSPF Areas (Data Center: Area 1, Companies: Areas 2-4, Core: Area 0)

### ✅ **Part 4: Connectivity & Testing**
- Verified network connectivity using **ping** and **tracert**.
- Tested access to `www.FirstSem2024.com` from all PCs.
- Ensured successful email communication between network clients.

## 📂 Contents

- 📜 **topology.pkt:** Packet Tracer project file with full network configuration.
- 📄 **Project Report (Project2_ENCS3320.pdf & project2_compressed.pdf):** Detailed documentation of implementation steps and results.
 
## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open **Packet Tracer** and load the `topology.pkt` file.
2. Navigate to routers and enter OSPF configurations.
3. Use command-line tools like `ping`, `tracert`, and `nslookup` to verify connectivity.
4. Open a browser on a PC and access `www.FirstSem2024.com`.
5. Test email communication between configured PCs.

## 📌 Requirements

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (For Network Simulation)
- **Basic Networking Knowledge** (IP Addressing, Routing Protocols, and Subnetting)
